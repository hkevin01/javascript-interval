- Create feature branches for new work
- Use pull requests for merging

## CI/CD Pipelines
- GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy
- Automated linting and formatting
- Test coverage reporting

## Code Review Process
- All changes require PR review
- Use comments for feedback
- Approve or request changes before merging

## Automation
- Scripts for build, test, and deployment in `scripts/`
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality

## Documentation
- Update documentation with every major change
- Keep API docs and architecture diagrams in `docs/`
